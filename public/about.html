<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am currently completing my Ausbildung in Mediengestalter Digital and Print at Macromedia School in Munich, Germany. My studies focus on digital media design, including print and web design.

I have a strong passion for web development, specializing in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React. I enjoy creating responsive, user-friendly websites and working with UI/UX design. Additionally, I have experience with WordPress, Figma, and Adobe Creative Suite.

As I finish my studies this summer, I am looking forward to new opportunities in the web development and digital design industry. ðŸš€ </p>
